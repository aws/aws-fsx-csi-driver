## Amazon FSx for Lustre CSI Driver
### Overview

The [Amazon FSx for Lustre](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/) Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver implements [CSI](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) specification for container orchestrators (CO) to manage lifecycle of Amazon FSx for Lustre filesystems.

### CSI Specification Compability Matrix
| AWS FSx for Lustre CSI Driver \ CSI Version       | v0.3.0| v1.0.0 |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|
| master branch                                     | yes   | no     |

### Features
The following CSI interfaces are implemented:
* Controller Service: CreateVolume, DeleteVolume, ControllerGetCapabilities, ValidateVolumeCapabilities
* Node Service: NodePublishVolume, NodeUnpublishVolume, NodeGetCapabilities, NodeGetInfo, NodeGetId
* Identity Service: GetPluginInfo, GetPluginCapabilities, Probe

## FSx for Lustre CSI Driver on Kubernetes
Following sections are Kubernetes specific. If you are Kubernetes user, use followings for driver features, installation steps and examples.

### Kubernetes Version Compability Matrix
| AWS FSx for Lustre CSI Driver \ Kubernetes Version| v1.11 | v1.12 | v1.13 |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|
| master branch                                     | yes   | yes   | yes   |

### Features
* Static provisioning - FSx for Lustre file system needs to be created manually first, then it could be mounted inside container as a volume using the Driver.
* Dynamic provisioning - uses persistence volume claim (PVC) to let the Kuberenetes to create the FSx for Lustre filesystem for you and consumes the volume from inside container.

### Installation
Checkout the project:
```sh
>> git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-fsx-csi-driver.git
>> cd aws-fsx-csi-driver
```

Edit the [secret manifest](../deploy/kubernetes/secret.yaml) using your favorite text editor. The secret should have enough permission to create FSx for Lustre filesystem. Then deploy the secret:

```sh
>> kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/secret.yaml
```

Then deploy the driver:

```sh
>> kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/controller.yaml
>> kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/node.yaml
```

### Examples
Before the example, you need to:
* Get yourself familiar with how to setup Kubernetes on AWS and [create FSx for Lustre filesystem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/getting-started.html#getting-started-step1) if you are using static provisioning.
* When creating FSx for Lustre file system, make sure its VPC is accessible from Kuberenetes cluster's VPC and network traffic is allowed by security group. 
  * For FSx for Lustre VPC, you can either create FSx for lustre filesystem inside the same VPC as Kubernetes cluster or using VPC peering.
  * For security group, make sure port 988 is allowed for the security groups that are attached the lustre filesystem ENI.
* Install FSx for Lustre CSI driver following the [Installation](README.md#Installation) steps.

* [Dynamic provisioning](../examples/kubernetes/dynamic_provisioning/README.md)
* [Dynamic provisioning with S3 integration](../examples/kubernetes/dynamic_provisioning_s3/README.md)
* [Accessing the filesystem from multiple pods](../examples/kubernetes/multiple_pods/README.md)

## Development
Please go through [CSI Spec](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) and [General CSI driver development guideline](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/Development.html) to get some basic understanding of CSI driver before you start.
